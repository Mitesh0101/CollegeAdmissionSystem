## About
The **College Admission Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to streamline the college admission process. Students can register, login, explore colleges, and secure admissions based on their academic performance. The system supports two types of colleges â€” **Government Colleges** (offering scholarships) and **Private Colleges** (offering management quota seats).

Admins have full control to add, update, remove, and view college data.
